The goal of my project is recreating the game of snake. I’m not sure how difficult this
would be to implement. If I find that it is too difficult, I’ll probably make a simplified
version of it. If too easy, I’ll probably add more features, such as a start screen or screen
looping.

My main learning goal is to understand what exactly goes into programming in
languages with more manual control such as C. How difficult would it be to manually
control memory allocation and how easy / difficult is it to expand to more complex
programs such as a more advanced video game.

One of the main reasons I chose this project was because of how accessible it is. There
is an endless number of tutorials on youtube on the topic. I will attempt to develop an
outline of the main chunks I need before approaching the program without using the
tutorials as a guide. I will also attempt to customize the game to increase the difficulty for
myself to not allow myself to lean on tutorials for guidance. I will most likely start by
reading an article as it would explain the process more analytically rather than using
code just so I’d get a better intuition of how to approach the game.

I will be doing this solo, which is why I didn’t choose something too extreme. This course
is also my first introduction to C programming. I will start by reading an article explaining
how to approach the game. Then I will create an outline of the parts I need (especially
where I’d anticipate to experience difficulty). I will then make a plan on how to tackle
each one, annotating whether I’d research the topic or play around with it in C. My final
demonstration for this would be an annotated outline detailing the steps of
implementation.
